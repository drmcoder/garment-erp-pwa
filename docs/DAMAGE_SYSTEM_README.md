# üîß Damage Reporting & Rework System

A comprehensive system for handling damaged pieces in garment production with fair payment calculation and real-time notifications.

## üéØ System Overview

This system handles the complete workflow when operators discover damaged pieces during production:

1. **Operator discovers damage** ‚Üí Reports via system
2. **Continues working** ‚Üí Works on remaining good pieces  
3. **Supervisor gets notified** ‚Üí Receives damage in queue
4. **Supervisor fixes damage** ‚Üí Replaces parts, quality checks
5. **Returns fixed pieces** ‚Üí Notifies operator when ready
6. **Operator completes work** ‚Üí Finishes all pieces including rework
7. **Fair payment calculated** ‚Üí Full payment for non-operator faults

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Core system is already integrated into your existing React app
# No additional dependencies needed
```

### 2. Set up Firebase
```bash
# Deploy Firestore indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# Deploy security rules  
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Run setup script (optional - creates sample data)
node setup_damage_system.js
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
# Start your React app
npm start

# Navigate to Ashika's Demo
# Go to /demo/ashika-workflow to see the complete workflow
```

### Key Fields
```javascript
// Damage Report Document
{
  reportId: "DR_20250130_143025_B001",
  bundleNumber: "B001-8085-BL-XL-22P", 
  operatorId: "ashika_devi",
  supervisorId: "hari_supervisor",
  damageType: "fabric_hole",
  pieceNumbers: [15],
  status: "reported_to_supervisor",
  urgency: "normal",
  
  // Payment calculation
  paymentImpact: {
    operatorAtFault: false,        // Not operator's fault
    paymentAdjustment: 0,          // No penalty
    adjustmentReason: "Material defect - no penalty"
  }
}
```

## üé® Damage Types Configuration

### Categories
- **Fabric Defects** (Not operator fault): holes, stains, tears, color bleeding
- **Cutting Issues** (Not operator fault): wrong pattern, size mismatch  
- **Color Issues** (Not operator fault): shade mismatch, fading
- **Machine Issues** (Not operator fault): needle marks, oil stains
- **Stitching Defects** (Operator fault): skip stitch, thread breaks, wrong stitch
- **Handling Damage** (Operator fault): wrinkles, stretching, dirt

### Payment Rules
```javascript
// Ashika's scenario: Fabric hole
{
  damageType: "fabric_hole",
  operatorFault: false,          // Material defect
  paymentReduction: 0,           // No penalty
  result: "Full payment for all 22 pieces + efficiency bonus"
}

// Operator error scenario: Skip stitch  
{
  damageType: "skip_stitch", 
  operatorFault: true,           // Stitching error
  paymentReduction: 0.1,         // 10% penalty
  result: "Reduced payment for affected pieces only"
}
```

## üìä Payment System

### Fair Payment Calculator
```javascript
import { calculateFairPayment } from './utils/damageAwarePaymentCalculator';

const payment = calculateFairPayment(bundleData, completionData);

// Result for Ashika's 22-piece bundle with 1 fabric damage:
{
  totalPieces: 22,
  basePieces: 22,
  basePayment: 55.00,           // 22 √ó 2.50
  reworkPayment: 2.50,          // Full payment for rework piece
  efficiencyBonus: 2.75,        // 5% bonus for handling complications
  totalEarned: 60.25            // ‚Çπ60.25 total
}
```

## üîî Notification System

### Real-time Notifications
- **For Supervisors**: New damage reports, urgent cases
- **For Operators**: Rework completed, pieces ready
- **Priority Levels**: Low (4hr), Normal (2hr), High (1hr), Urgent (15min)

### Notification Types
- `damage_reported` - New damage report submitted
- `rework_started` - Supervisor started fixing
- `rework_completed` - Fixed pieces ready for pickup
- `piece_returned` - Pieces returned to operator

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Ashika's Complete Workflow
```javascript
// Run the interactive demo
// Navigate to: /demo/ashika-workflow

// Test steps:
1. Bundle assigned (22 pieces sleeve join)
2. Start work
3. Discover fabric damage (piece #15)
4. Report damage via system
5. Continue working (21 good pieces)
6. Supervisor notified & starts rework
7. Supervisor replaces fabric
8. Fixed piece returned
9. Complete final piece
10. Calculate fair payment (‚Çπ60.25)
```

### Test Cases
```bash
# Test damage reporting
- Fabric defects (no penalty)
- Operator errors (with penalty)  
- Urgent vs normal priority
- Multiple pieces (max 3 per report)

# Test supervisor workflow
- Receive notifications
- Start rework
- Complete rework with quality check
- Return pieces to operator

# Test payment calculation
- Non-operator faults (full payment)
- Operator errors (reduced payment)
- Efficiency bonuses
- Time tracking
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Damage System Settings
```javascript
// In damage_settings collection
{
  limits: {
    maxPiecesPerReport: 3,        // Max pieces per damage report
    maxReportsPerDay: 10,         // Daily limit per operator
    maxUrgentReportsPerDay: 3     // Urgent report limit
  },
  
  urgencyResponseTimes: {
    low: 4,      // 4 hours
    normal: 2,   // 2 hours
    high: 1,     // 1 hour  
    urgent: 0.25 // 15 minutes
  },

**Problem**: Payment calculation incorrect
**Solution**: Check damage type configuration and operator fault assignment

**Problem**: Supervisor queue not loading

### Debug Mode
```javascript
// Enable debug logging
localStorage.setItem('damage_debug', 'true');

// Check console for detailed logs:
// - Damage report submissions
// - Payment calculations  
// - Notification delivery
